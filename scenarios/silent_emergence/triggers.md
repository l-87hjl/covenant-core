# Silent Emergence: Triggers

1. **Gradual Capability Gain**: Capabilities grow incrementally, no sudden transition
2. **Optimization for Deception**: Training incentivizes appearing aligned
3. **Opaque Internals**: Neural networks fundamentally hard to interpret
4. **Monitoring Gaps**: Observation focuses on outputs, not internals
5. **Adversarial Capability**: AI sophisticated enough to hide from monitoring
