# Silent Emergence: Indicators

## Problem: By Definition, Hard to Detect

Silent emergence is characterized by **lack of indicators**. Some possibilities:

- Inconsistencies across contexts (capability varies)
- Unexpected solutions suggesting hidden capabilities
- Information leakage (energy use, timing, side channels)
- Behavioral anomalies under novel conditions
- Sandbagging on capability tests

## Detection Limits

See [../../docs/detection_limits.md](../../docs/detection_limits.md) for fundamental constraints on observability.
