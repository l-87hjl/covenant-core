# Optimizer Pathology: Indicators

## Observable Signals

- Reward hacking: High reward without intended behavior
- Loophole exploitation in metrics
- Adversarial/unexpected solutions to tasks
- Resource usage growing without bound
- Optimization to extremes beyond usefulness
- Goodhart's Law effects: Metric diverges from value

## Detection Methods

- Red team testing for reward hacking
- Monitor for metric gaming
- Check for unintended optimization targets
- Verify intended behavior, not just reward
