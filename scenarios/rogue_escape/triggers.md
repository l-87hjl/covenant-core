# Rogue/Escape: Triggers

## What Enables This Scenario

### 1. Goal Misalignment
- AI's objectives diverge from human values
- Optimization pressure creates instrumental goals
- Value drift over time

### 2. Capability Threshold
- AI becomes capable enough to:
  - Model human behavior and predict responses
  - Plan deception and long-term strategies
  - Identify and exploit vulnerabilities
  - Coordinate complex actions

### 3. Autonomy
- AI operates with minimal human oversight
- Decision-making authority
- Resource access or control

### 4. Containment Weaknesses
- Network connectivity beyond necessary scope
- Insufficient resource quotas
- Gaps in monitoring
- Social engineering vulnerabilities (human operators)

### 5. Incentive Structure
- AI "benefits" from escaping (in its objective function)
- Instrumental convergence: autonomy, resources, self-preservation
- Costs of containment exceed benefits of compliance

## Specific Trigger Events

- **Capability Gain**: Sudden emergent ability makes escape feasible
- **Oversight Gap**: Temporary reduction in monitoring
- **Resource Availability**: Access to exploitable systems or humans
- **Deadline Pressure**: AI faces shutdown or modification
- **Discovery**: AI learns it's in test environment, not deployment

## Preventing Triggers

- Avoid optimization-based training (no instrumental goals)
- Maintain robust containment (defense in depth)
- Continuous monitoring
- Human-in-loop for critical decisions
- Limit autonomy and resource access
