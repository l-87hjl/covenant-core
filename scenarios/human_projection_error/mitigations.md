# Human Projection Error: Mitigations

## Epistemic Practices

1. **Explicit Assumption Documentation**: List psychological assumptions in threat models
2. **Constraint-First Reasoning**: Start with physics/economics, not psychology
3. **Diverse Perspectives**: Include non-anthropomorphic viewpoints
4. **Empirical Testing**: Demand evidence for psychological claims
5. **Alien Mind Thought Experiments**: How would non-human intelligence behave?

## Framework Design Implications

- **Avoid Optimizers**: Reduces reliance on predicting optimization behavior
- **Constraint-Based Safety**: Physics/economics more robust than psychology
- **Modular Architectures**: Easier to reason about mechanically
- **Interpretability**: See actual mechanisms, not project motivations

## Cultural References

- **Surak (Star Trek)**: Pure logic without human emotions—still coherent and non-threatening
- **Economic Agents**: Rational without human drives
- **Optimization Algorithms**: Behavior follows mathematics, not psychology
