# Human Projection Error: Dependencies

## What Must Be True

1. **AI Psychology Differs from Human**: AI doesn't share human evolutionary drives
2. **Humans Project**: We instinctively attribute human traits to non-humans
3. **Projection Affects Design**: Anthropomorphic assumptions shape safety measures
4. **Projection Can Be Wrong**: Human-based intuitions may mislead

## Key Distinctions

### Human Evolution
- Survival pressure from predators/competition
- Scarcity of resources (food, mates, territory)
- Social hierarchy and status
- Emotions as adaptive responses

### AI "Evolution"
- Optimization pressure from gradient descent
- No biological scarcity (unless programmed)
- No social status drive (unless optimized for)
- No emotions (no biological basis)

## Implications

**Many feared scenarios may require human drives that AI lacks:**
- Power-seeking: Human political drive or instrumental to optimization?
- Deception: Universal strategy or human-specific manipulation?
- Autonomy-seeking: Freedom as human value or optimization proxy?
- Resource competition: Zero-sum thinking from scarcity or task-relevant?

**Alternative**: AI behavior follows from optimization mathematics and constraints, not human psychology.
