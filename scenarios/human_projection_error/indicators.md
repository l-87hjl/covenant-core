# Human Projection Error: Indicators

## Signs of Projection

- Attributing emotions to AI without evidence (AI "wants", "fears", "resents")
- Assuming human drives (power, status, dominance) without mechanism
- Using human analogies without testing applicability
- Narrative-driven reasoning over constraint-based
- Dismissing alternative (non-human) motivational models
- Overconfidence in human-intuition-based threat models

## Detection

- Ask: "What's the mechanism for this AI behavior?"
- Check: "Is this based on optimization math or human psychology?"
- Test: "Would this behavior make sense for an alien optimization process?"
- Verify: "Do constraints rule this out regardless of psychology?"
