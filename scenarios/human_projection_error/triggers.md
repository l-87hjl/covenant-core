# Human Projection Error: Triggers

## What Enables This Error

1. **Anthropomorphic Bias**: Humans evolved to model other humans, over-apply to AI
2. **Lack of Empirical Data**: Limited experience with non-human intelligence
3. **Narrative Convenience**: Human-like AI is easier to reason about and communicate
4. **Science Fiction Influence**: Popular narratives feature human-like AI motivations
5. **Emotional Resonance**: Fearful scenarios feel more compelling if human-like

## Preventing This Error

- Question assumptions explicitly
- Demand empirical evidence for psychological claims
- Consider constraints (physics, economics) over psychology
- Study non-human optimization systems
- Diverse perspectives in AI safety discourse
