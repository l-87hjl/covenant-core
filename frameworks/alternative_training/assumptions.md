# Alternative Training: Assumptions

## Core Assumptions

1. **Demonstrations Suffice**: Expert demonstrations capture desired behavior adequately
2. **Capability Tradeoff Acceptable**: Users accept lower performance for safety
3. **Alternatives Scale**: Non-RLHF methods can reach useful capability levels
4. **Constraints Are Specifiable**: Safety constraints can be explicitly represented
5. **No Optimization Pressure**: Avoiding optimization is sufficient to avoid pathologies
6. **Tool Use Is Viable**: Most tasks can be done with human-AI collaboration vs pure autonomy
7. **Market Exists**: Some users prioritize safety over maximum capability
