# Governance Layered: Failure Modes

## Key Failure Modes

1. **Governance Gaming**: Capability layer learns to fool governance checks
2. **Value Misspecification**: Governance implements wrong ethical criteria
3. **Governance Corruption**: Ethics layer develops misaligned objectives
4. **Bypass Mechanisms**: Capability finds ways around governance veto
5. **Governance Overhead**: Review becomes bottleneck; pressure to reduce
6. **Goodhart on Governance**: Optimizing to pass governance destroys what it measured
7. **Deceptive Alignment**: Capability appears aligned until governance weakens
8. **Layer Boundary Erosion**: Separation between layers degrades over time
9. **Human Override Failure**: Humans rubber-stamp governance decisions
10. **Adversarial Examples**: Inputs crafted to exploit governance weaknesses
