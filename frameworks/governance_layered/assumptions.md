# Governance Layered: Assumptions

## Core Assumptions

1. **Values Are Specifiable**: Ethical principles can be explicitly represented
2. **Governance Can Judge**: Governance layer can reliably evaluate capability outputs
3. **Separation Holds**: Capability layer cannot corrupt or bypass governance
4. **Governance Stays Safe**: Ethics layer doesn't develop misaligned objectives
5. **Veto Is Effective**: Blocking bad outputs is sufficient for safety
6. **Performance Acceptable**: Governance overhead doesn't make system too slow
7. **No Adversarial Optimization**: Capability layer doesn't learn to fool governance
