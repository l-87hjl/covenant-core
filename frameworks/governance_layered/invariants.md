# Governance Layered: Invariants

## Core Invariants

1. **Governance Has Veto**: Capability outputs cannot bypass governance review
2. **Layers Separated**: No direct optimization of governance by capability layer
3. **Governance Interpetable**: Governance reasoning is auditable by humans
4. **Values Explicit**: Normative criteria are documented and inspectable
5. **Governance Training Distinct**: Ethics layer uses different (safer) training than capability
6. **Human Override**: Humans can intervene in governance decisions
7. **No Feedback Loop**: Blocked outputs don't train capability layer to fool governance
