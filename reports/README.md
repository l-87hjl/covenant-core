# Reports

## Purpose

This folder contains generated analyses, comparison matrices, and synthesis documents produced from the framework taxonomy.

## Types of Reports

### Comparison Matrices
- Framework vs scenario response matrices
- Primitive usage across frameworks
- Constraint sensitivity analyses

### Synthesis Documents
- Cross-framework insights
- Primitive effectiveness evaluations
- Scenario likelihood assessments

### Analysis Reports
- Constraint analysis for specific scenarios
- Deep-dives on architectural tradeoffs
- Meta-analyses of safety approaches

## Generation

Reports can be:
- **Manual**: Written analyses synthesizing framework content
- **Semi-Automated**: Templates filled from framework documentation
- **Automated**: Generated from simulation outputs (future)

## Status

**Currently**: Empty - reports will be generated as framework matures
**Future**: Populated with systematic comparisons and analyses

## Usage

When adding reports:
1. Include metadata header (date, author, scope)
2. Reference source material in frameworks/, scenarios/, primitives/
3. Document assumptions and limitations
4. Provide actionable insights where possible
5. Update this README to index new reports
