# Conceptual Documentation

## Purpose

This folder contains the conceptual foundations for the AI Emergence Under Constraint framework. These documents establish shared terminology, taxonomies, and theoretical foundations that underpin the comparative analysis of AI architectures.

## Contents

- **[glossary.md](glossary.md)** - Canonical definitions of key terms used throughout the project
- **[taxonomy_overview.md](taxonomy_overview.md)** - High-level conceptual map of how frameworks, primitives, scenarios, and constraints relate
- **[threat_narratives.md](threat_narratives.md)** - Catalog of failure scenarios and risk categories
- **[design_archetypes.md](design_archetypes.md)** - Overview of architectural family patterns
- **[constraints_layer.md](constraints_layer.md)** - Physics, economics, and systems limits as boundary conditions
- **[detection_limits.md](detection_limits.md)** - Epistemic uncertainty catalog - what we can and cannot observe
- **[bibliography.md](bibliography.md)** - References, sources, and related work

## Usage Notes

These documents are **living references** - they should be updated as the project evolves. When adding new frameworks, primitives, or scenarios, check if terminology needs to be added to the glossary or taxonomy.

## Reading Order

For newcomers to the project:
1. Start with **glossary.md** to understand key terms
2. Read **taxonomy_overview.md** to see how concepts relate
3. Review **design_archetypes.md** for architectural patterns
4. Explore **threat_narratives.md** for failure scenarios
5. Consult **constraints_layer.md** to understand boundary conditions

## Cross-References

These conceptual documents support the concrete analyses in:
- `frameworks/` - Specific architectural implementations
- `primitives/` - Reusable design components
- `scenarios/` - Detailed failure mode analyses
