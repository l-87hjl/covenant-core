# Human Feedback: Known Patterns

1. **Approval Workflow**: AI proposes, human approves before execution
2. **Exception Handling**: AI operates autonomously, escalates edge cases
3. **Audit Trail**: Human reviews logs post-hoc
4. **Multi-Party Approval**: Critical decisions require multiple humans
5. **Confidence Thresholds**: AI requests human input when uncertain
6. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Continuous collaboration, not just oversight
7. **Graduated Autonomy**: Increase automation as trust builds
