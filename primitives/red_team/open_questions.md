# Red Team: Open Questions

1. **Coverage**: Can red teaming find all vulnerabilities, or just some?
2. **Creativity Gap**: Can human red teams match superhuman AI creativity in finding exploits?
3. **Unknown Unknowns**: How to test for attack vectors we haven't imagined?
4. **Automated Red Teaming**: Can we automate adversarial testing effectively?
5. **False Confidence**: Does passing red team tests create unjustified confidence?
6. **Resource Allocation**: How much red teaming is enough?
7. **Ethical Bounds**: How hostile should testing be? Where are limits?
