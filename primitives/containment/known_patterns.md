# Containment: Known Patterns

1. **Air Gap**: Complete physical network isolation
2. **Sandbox**: Restricted execution environment (Docker, VMs, chroot)
3. **Least Privilege**: Minimal necessary permissions
4. **Network Segmentation**: VLANs, firewalls, DMZs
5. **Rate Limiting**: Throttle resource usage
6. **Honeypots**: Fake resources to detect boundary probing
7. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple containment layers
8. **Kill Switch**: Emergency shutdown mechanism
