# References

## Purpose

This folder contains external reference materials, cultural anchors, and examples that help communicate AI safety concepts through familiar narratives.

## Contents

- **[cultural_anchors/](cultural_anchors/)** - Science fiction and cultural examples that illustrate AI concepts

## Usage

Cultural anchors serve multiple purposes:
1. **Communication**: Make abstract concepts concrete through familiar narratives
2. **Thought Experiments**: Explore scenarios through fictional examples
3. **Analogy**: Bridge technical concepts to broader audiences
4. **Warning Cases**: Classic examples of what can go wrong

## Caveats

- Cultural references are **illustrations**, not rigorous analyses
- Fiction often gets AI wrong (anthropomorphism, human-like motivations)
- Use as communication tools, not design guides
- Beware of importing fictional assumptions into real safety work

## Cross-References

- **Scenarios**: [scenarios/](../scenarios/) - Rigorous failure mode analyses
- **Docs**: [docs/threat_narratives.md](../docs/threat_narratives.md) - Conceptual framework
